The JupyterLab extension is based on [the spellchecker Jupyter Notebook extension](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/spellchecker) and relies on [Typo.js](https://github.com/cfinke/Typo.js) for the actual spell checking. Spellchecker suggestions are available from the context menu.

The extension provides (Hunspell) [SCOWL](http://wordlist.aspell.net/) dictionaries for American, British, Canadian, and Australian English.

## JupyterLab Version

The extension has been tested up to JupyterLab version 2.2.0.
